2. Edit the page in advanced mode.
3. Add the web part to a suitable web part zone. The web part is found in the "Omnia" Category.

Here's how to add a block to a Quick Page:

1. Go to the page.
2. Open the Actions Menu and select "Edit page".
3. Open the list of blocks.
4. Use drag and drop to add the block to a suitable area.
